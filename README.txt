This is a website that allows you to inquire about your disease from the comfort of your own home.
Avoid waiting in line and taking a day off to see your doctor, as well as the chance of human error.
The procedure is very simple - type in the symptoms and select the recommended options that best
describe your case from the drop down, and wait for our website to calculate the possibility of
diseases by comparing your symptoms to the ones that characterize each of the diseases in our
database. Furthermore, we can suggest medicine and treatment that you can use.
If you want more insight, we suggest you talk to our certified doctors for professional evaluation
and recommendations. Disclaimer: if you have symptoms of a very serious disease we highly encourage
you to physically visit a health institution. In case the website suggests a medicine that requires
a prescription from a professional institution, please make sure you visit your doctor and get one.
